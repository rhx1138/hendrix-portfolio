                My goal is to create beautiful, usable, professional websites using industry best practices. Design is
                crucial in creating software people enjoy using. For this reason, my designs are simple, but effective.

            <p> I am currently living in Terre Haute, Indiana and have been involved within the research and consulting
                field for more than five years. I recently switched my career to Front-end Development due to an
                internal project at my company that I had been involved with focusing on UI.
            </p> <br>

                My background in research methodology while working closely with clients towards a solution as well as
                my background in Graphic Design, has been highly beneficial in making such a transition into this great
                field.
